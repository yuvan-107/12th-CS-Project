The objective of the project is to create a useful program for an imaginary Animal Rescue NGO. 

The NGO which, obviously, rescues animals will have the need to store some stuff. This application will help the NGO to store the required data. 

Using this application, the NGO can store information about:

> The Animals Rescued
> Details of the Volunteers
> Their Expenses
> The Donation Amount Received
