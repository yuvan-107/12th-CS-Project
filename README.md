The objective of the project is to create a useful program for an imaginary Animal Rescue NGO using tkinter library. 

The NGO which, obviously, rescues animals will have the need to store some stuff. This application will help the NGO to store the required data. 

Using this application, the NGO can store information (in a CSV file) about:

* The Animals Rescued
* Details of the Volunteers
* Their Expenses
* The Donation Amount Received




PS: As of now, the functions it offer is barebones. I might consider implementing more features into it (like using matplotlib to visualise data)
